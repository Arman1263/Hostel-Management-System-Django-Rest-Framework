If someone wants to use your project on their system, here’s the **clean, no-BS answer**.

---

# 🔹 What They Need

Only two things:

1. Docker installed
2. Internet connection

They do **NOT** need:

* Python
* Node
* Django
* React
* Your source code

That’s the whole point of pushing images to **Docker Hub**.

---

# 🔹 The Simple Way (Manual Run)

They just run:

### 1️⃣ Backend

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name backend armanshikalgar/hostel-backend:1.0
```

### 2️⃣ Frontend

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name frontend armanshikalgar/hostel-frontend:1.0
```

Then open:

* [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Done.

---

# 🔹 The Correct Way (Professional Way)

You give them a `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  backend:
    image: armanshikalgar/hostel-backend:1.0
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  frontend:
    image: armanshikalgar/hostel-frontend:1.0
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

They just run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That’s how real projects are shared.

---

# 🔥 What You Should Actually Do (Important)

Inside your GitHub README, add:

## How to Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That’s it.

If your README says:

> Install Python, install Node, install dependencies, run migrations…

You failed at containerization.

---

# ⚠ Honest Reality Check

Because you’re using SQLite:

* If they remove the backend container → data gone
* If they restart container → data stays (unless removed)

So your container is usable, but not production-grade.
